# Star Type Classification Project

## Overview
This project aims to classify different types of stars using various learned data science techniques. The goal is to accurately predict the type of a star based on its physical properties.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following variables for each star:
- Temperature (in Kelvin)
- Luminosity (L, in L/Lo)
- Absolute Magnitude (AM, in Mv)
- Color (General Color of Spectrum)
- Spectral Class (O, B, A, F, G, K, M)
- Type (categorized from 0 to 5):
  - 0: Red Dwarf
  - 1: Brown Dwarf
  - 2: White Dwarf
  - 3: Main Sequence
  - 4: Super Giants
  - 5: Hyper Giants

## Features
- Data analysis and visualization using libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
- Exploration of star properties through statistical methods.
- Application of machine learning techniques for classification.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scipy (for specific versions, see `requirements.txt`).

## Installation
To set up the project environment:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TirtheshJani/star-type-classification.git
cd star-type-classification
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the Jupyter Notebook and view the data analysis and classification process, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
jupyter notebook Startypeclassificationproject.ipynb
```
